### Summary
**Stacks**: Useful for LIFO operations like reversing elements, backtracking, and expression evaluation.
**Queues**: Useful for FIFO operations like task scheduling, breadth-first search, and buffering.
**Balancing Parentheses**: Uses a stack to ensure every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
**Evaluating Postfix Expressions**: Uses a stack to evaluate expressions where the operator follows its operands.
These implementations and examples cover fundamental operations and applications of stacks and queues in Golang.
