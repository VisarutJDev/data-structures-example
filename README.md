- **Practice**: Work on problems that involve linked list manipulations.

### Stacks and Queues
- **Key Concepts**: Implementations and common problems like balancing parentheses and evaluating expressions.
- **Practice**: Study the use of stacks and queues in various algorithmic problems.

### Trees and Graphs
- **Key Concepts**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS.
- **Practice**: Focus on tree traversals, graph searches, and understanding tree balancing.

### Heaps
- **Key Concepts**: Heap operations and applications such as implementing a priority queue.
- **Practice**: Solve problems related to heaps, like finding the k-th largest element.

### Hash Tables
- **Key Concepts**: Hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and their applications.
- **Practice**: Work on problems involving efficient data retrieval and storage using hash tables.
